For each frame:
    Get detections
    Predict positions for all active tracks (Kalman)
        - consider the time as an input!
    
    If num_detections >= 1:
        If num_detections >= 2:
            Estimate global translation via RANSAC
        Else:
            Use translation from single correspondence (against whichever track it's closest to)

        Apply global translation to predicted positions

        Build cost matrix between detections and motion-compensated tracks
        Run Hungarian assignment

        For each matched pair:
            Update Kalman filter, reset missed count

        For unmatched tracks:
            Increment missed count, keep predicting

        For unmatched detections:
            Start new tracks with unique IDs

    Else:
        No detections â€” all tracks predict forward
        Increment missed count for all tracks

    Remove tracks exceeding max_age missed frames
